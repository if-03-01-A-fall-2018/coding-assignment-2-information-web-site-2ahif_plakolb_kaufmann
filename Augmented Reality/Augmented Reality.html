      <h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment) or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).Augmented Reality (AR) is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable.</p>

      <h2>Technology (for AR)</h2>
      <p>Hardware components for augmented reality are: processor, display, sensors and input devices. Modern mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers contain these elements which often include a camera and MEMS sensors such as accelerometer, GPS, and solid state compass, making them suitable AR platforms.

      <h2>Nett2Know</h2>
      <p>There is a danger that AR will make individuals overconfident and put their life at risk because of it. Pokémon GO with a couple of deaths and many injuries is the perfect example of it. "Death by Pokémon GO”, by a pair of researchers from Purdue University's Krannert School of Management, says the game caused “a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes and associated vehicular damage, personal injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations, called PokéStops, where users can play the game while driving. Furthermore, more than one in three surveyed advanced internet users would like to edit out disturbing elements around them, such as garbage or graffiti.[253] They would like to even modify their surroundings by erasing street signs, billboard ads, and uninteresting shopping windows.</p>
