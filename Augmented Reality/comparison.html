        <h2>Virtual Reality Overview (VR)</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>In VR you are fully closed of Headset so you do not see the real World, you are completly colsed of in the Virtual Reality. That makes VR much more vulnerable to motion sickness. It also is more expensive and much more difficult to set up because you have to set up the external sensors and calibrated them with the headset and controller.</p>
          </section>
          <h2>Mixed Reality (MR)</h2>
            <section>
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Mixed Reality(MR) or hybrid reality is the merging of real and virtual world. MR takes place not only in the physical world but also in the virtual world, it is a mix of AR and VR. Its cheaper than VR and its nearly "Plug n Play" because you do not have to set up and calibrate external sensors.</p>

            <h2>Extended Reality (XR)</h2>
              <section>
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Extended reality goes from "complete real" to "complete virtual"</p>
